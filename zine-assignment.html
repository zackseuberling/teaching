          <h1>Assignment 2, Publishing a digital Zine</h1>

          <h2>Part 1 - Research</h2>

          <p>
            Brainstorm and research what your zine will be about. What makes a
            compelling choice for your zine? Choose at least 3 different topics
            to explore before making a final decision. It is important for me to
            see you have done some amount of research before choosing a topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be turning your research in along with your design and
            website so produce these materials in a way that can be shared
            (Figma, Figjam, text, etc.)
          </p>

          <h3>Resources</h3>

              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Part 2 - Design</h2>

          <p>
            Design your website in Figma. We'll be writing and creating all the
            content for the website, so if you need to produce images, do so
            however you please: Photoshop, drawing and scanning documents, etc.
            The final design document will be a Figma file with your text and
            images in place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Show your design progress. I want to see where you started and where
            you end up!
          </p>

          <h2>Part 3 - Development</h2>

          <p>
            Putting it all together! Using everything from class, build your
            website!
          </p>
