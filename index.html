          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            This is an unusual class: we won’t have time to learn how to build
            dynamic, complex, and responsive websites. But! We have a lot of
            time to think about and discuss digital design for the web so that
            we may communicate more clearly and initiate our own learning down
            the road.

          <h2>Support for students with disabilities</h2>
          <p>
            Seattle University values diverse types of learners and is committed
            to ensuring that each student is afforded an equal opportunity to
            participate in learning experiences. For disability and other
            learning-related needs and accommodations that you have already
            arranged via Disability Services, please communicate with me during
            the first week of class through email or Zoom. Should concerns arise
            at any point in the quarter, please let me know as soon as possible.
            If you have, or think you may have, a disability (including an
            “invisible disability” such as a learning disability, a chronic
            health problem, or a mental health condition) that interferes with
            your performance as a student in this class, but have not yet
            arranged support services and/or accommodations, I encourage you to
            do so through Disability Services staff at DS@seattleu.edu or (206)
            296-5740. Disability-based adjustments to course expectations can be
            arranged only through this process. I am committed to working with
            you, so please do not hesitate to contact me.

          <h2>Notice on religious accommodations</h2>
          <p>
            It is the policy of Seattle University to reasonably accommodate
            students who, due to the observance of religious holidays, expect to
            be absent or endure a significant hardship during certain days of
            their academic course or program. Please see, Policy on Religious
            Accommodations for Students.

          <h2>Community &amp; inclusivity</h2>
          <p>
            Seattle University has a stated commitment to diversity and
            inclusivity. In part, this includes an expectation that all members
            of our campus community treat one another with respect and care in
            the classroom. Actions or statements which espouse the supremacy of
            one group of people over another, or which marginalize any group,
            are not welcome in our classroom. Such attitudes are destructive to
            both our learning process and our community. All students in this
            course are welcomed and valued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia,
            religious prejudice, and other forms of discrimination have no place
            on our campus or in our classroom. Our class, like our campus, is
            one community. We learn together. We work together. And we will
            respect one another. We teach all students, regardless of background
            or beliefs. All students are equally welcome and valued. Growth
            mindset includes our ability to grow together, to learn to be more
            tolerant, and to become more compassionate. No one is being asked to
            leave the table. Everyone is being asked to make room at the table,
            so that everyone has a seat and a fair chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find that anything in our class is failing to live up to
            these principles (including if you feel that I myself have failed to
            live up to them), I encourage you to bring this issue up, either to
            me, or to your department chair, your advisor, advisors in the
            College of Science and Engineering Advising Center, or another
            faculty or staff member you feel comfortable talking with, who could
            pass on your concerns to myself or my department chair. You are also
            invited to reach out to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Student
            Ambassadors on Instagram @su_stemdei.
