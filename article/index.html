    <article class="center-column">
      <h2 class="five-columns">It took you 10 years to write your first book, and you’re three years into your new book.
        How do you maintain
        momentum over that kind of time period, and what does an average day look like?</h2>

      <p>First, I should say that 2018 was an exception for me, in that in a lot of ways I found it very hard to write
        fiction. I wrote quite a bit of nonfiction, but I kept having trouble finding the level of concentration I
        needed to be able to work on my second novel—because of some of the publicity around the first novel, and I was
        on the road so much.</p>

      <p>At some point I tweeted out, “Oh my god, is anyone able to write while in their pre-publication months?”
        Everyone wrote back and consoled me: “Oh, don’t worry about it. No one can write.” Then Alex Chee tweeted back,
        “You know, I’ve been able to,” and I was like, “Goddamn it.” If it’s possible, I want to be able to do it, too.
        I’m hoping to change my ways with the next book, but yeah. So after the first book, there was a lull when I
        barely wrote any fiction. Only this year, and really only in the past few months, have I gotten back to a place
        where I’m writing every day.</p>

      <p>I’ve been on the road a lot. The paperback came out about two months ago. I’m not complaining, but writing
        fiction, for me, requires space. My brain has to feel much more like a dreaming brain than a waking brain. So
        what I’ve been doing instead is, even if it’s a really, really busy day, I’ve been trying to write at least one
        sentence.</p>

      <p>I know it varies wildly for other writers, and some writers find this oppressive, but for me, I find it to be
        most helpful to write every day. I’m trying to get back to a space where I can write at least 300 words a day.
        But we’ll see. I’m trying to get back into the rhythm of it.</p>

      <h2 class="five-columns">There’s truth to the idea of: “Before this I was just writing for myself, but now that I
        have an audience, I’m
        writing for an audience.” Having success takes up time. A discussion, like we’re having now, takes away time
        from writing.</h2>

      <p>Yeah. And you know, again, I’m not complaining. I feel lucky for a lot that’s happened. I think I still haven’t
        entirely figured out how to find the quiet that seems to help me write. I’m very lucky there’s no one who’s
        directly dependent on me right now. There’s no one for whom I am a primary caretaker. In August, I was home for
        less than a week for the month.</p>

      <p>I keep trying to figure out ways to establish more routines even when my routine isn’t exactly the routine that
        I have at home. One thing that helps a lot is—even if I’m on tour, even if there’s a lot going on—I try hard to
        write first thing in the day. Sometimes that’s just one sentence. But at least I know that I’ve broken that
        seal. I feel so often that that first sentence is the most terrifying sentence to put down at the start of a
        writing day. And so, if I have that one sentence, then at least I know I wrote so that takes a little bit of the
        pressure off, and maybe I’ve given myself enough of an entry point that I can keep writing later in the day.</p>

      <h2 class="five-columns">After spending so much time on The Incendiaries, how did you know the book was done?
        Before it was, how did
        you keep the momentum going through that whole time period?</h2>

      <p>For the book to be considered done, I wanted it to get to a place where I could open it at random anywhere in
        the middle and read two sentences and not want to change anything about them all over again. And yeah, that took
        10 years.</p>

      <p>But I realized part of the problem was this same technique is how I decide what I’m going to read next. Unless
        I have a concrete obligation to read a certain book next—because I’m reviewing it or because it’s one of my
        closest friends or whatever it is—I have the giant piles of guilt that I’m sure everyone has, including you, of
        all the books I’ve bought, and all the books that people have sent me that I want to read and that, in a perfect
        world, I would already have read. But how I decide what I’m going to read next is I open a book at random and I
        read two lines from the middle. And if those feel alive to me, if those have something to them that I find to be
        interesting, then I keep reading. And so I realized I sort of screwed myself over because I had to apply that
        same persnickety test to my own prose.</p>
